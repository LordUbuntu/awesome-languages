# awesome-languages
A collection of new, interesting, and awesome programming languages!


# Contents

This is a stub, but a lot will be added. Many programming languages you're familiar with (Like C or Python), some languages you may be unfamiliar with (like Pascal), some interesting languages (like QCL, Janus, etc), emerging languages (at least 1000 stars and actively worked on, like [Kind](https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind)) (and of course, a link to the esoteric languages wiki). I encourage you to contribute if you find anything particularly cool that isn't already represtended here.
